# Machine Learning for Engineers in MATLAB

Machine learning adapts using data to gain experience. It is a convergence of linear algebra, statistics, optimization, and computational methods for computer systems to infer relationships and make decisions from data.

Examples of machine learning are now common and are expected to further influence transportation, entertainment, retail, and energy industries. This engineering course reviews theory and applications of machine learning to engineering applications with a survey of unsupervised and supervised learning methods.

The course combines mathematical details with several case studies that provide an intuition for machine learning with methods for classification, regression, and dimensionality reduction. A second phase of the course is a hands-on group project. The engineering problems and theory guide the student towards a working fluency in state-of-the-art methods implemented in MATLAB and Python.
